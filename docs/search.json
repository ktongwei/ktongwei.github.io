Quarto and Markdown\nI gained insights into formatting and structuring content in Markdown, enabling me to create professional and visually appealing documents. The seamless integration of text, media, and styling in Quarto is now clearer to me.\n\n\n2. Version Control with GitHub\nSetting up a private repository and linking it to my Quarto project highlighted the importance of version control and how it facilitates collaborative and iterative work.\n\n\n3. CSS Styling\nLearning to customize the website’s appearance through CSS was particularly valuable. From responsive design principles to specific styling techniques for navigation bars, images, and content sections, I now feel more confident in applying CSS to enhance user experience.\n\n\n4. Problem-Solving Approach\nGenAI demonstrated a methodical problem-solving approach—breaking tasks into smaller, actionable steps and iterating on feedback. This is a skill I plan to emulate in future projects."
